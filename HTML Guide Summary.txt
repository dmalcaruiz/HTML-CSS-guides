HTML Guide/Summary

Since some terms involved here can be very conceptually similar, it won't be hard to confuse them with one another (or with unrelated words) if you don't first memorize their meanings.
Most terms covered in this guide will depend on the understanding of certain specialized concepts.
This is written so each and every specialized term and concept used will have been already defined in a previous section.
If you read this carefully and in order most concepts will be clear.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

    HTML means Hypertext Markup Language.
    Hypertext is text that links (hyperlink) topics on screen to related information and graphics.
    A markup language is a language made up of symbols and codes, and meant to be read by a specialized program.
    When markup languages are read, they specify how these symbols should be displayed by the specialized program.

    HTML is essentially a system for interpreting tagged symbols and codes inserted in a document to achieve basic text, graphic, and hyperlink effects.

    It is important to know that content created in HTML is formatless, and is positioned in one of three formats by default: inline, block, and table.

    HTML documents are formatted with CSS, a graphic design markup language.

HTML Tags, Elements, Attributes and Values:

    [Tags] are used to mark up the start and end of an element.
    [Elements] represent some kind of structure or semantics and consist of a start tag, content, and an end tag.
    [Attributes] define the properties an element and their [values] determine how they do so.
    They consist of an [attribute]/[value] pair, and appear within the element's start tag.
    An element's start tag may contain any number of space separated [attribute]/[value] pairs.

        <tag>content</tag>

        <tag attribute="value">content</tag>

    The code snippets (fragments of code) above show the syntaxis of two HTML elements.

HTML Comments:

    HTML comments won't be read by the browser.
    They are useful for developers as they can leave any comment explaining a code snippet's purpose without interfering with the code.
    HTML Comments must start with a left arrow head followed by two hashes (<--) and end with an two hashes followed by a left arrow head (-->).

        <!-- This is an HTML Comment -->

Strings:

    A string is any set of characters within quotation marks.
    To include quotation marks within a string use the single quotation marks.
    Single quotation mark strings are also strings.

        "This is a string"
        " 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 "
        "¡!¿?:;&#$()+-*/%="
        "                     "
        '"q. marks within q. marks"'
        'also a string'

Nesting:

    HTML tags are similar to boxes around content.
    Sometimes you need to place boxes inside of other boxes.
    Those "inner" boxes are nested inside of others.
    When you nest tags (put them inside other tags), you have to close any [inner] tags before you can close the [outer] tags.

        <outer>
            <inner>
            </inner>
        </outer>

        <nesting>
            <nested>
            </nested>
        </nesting>

    The name given to an element that contains other elements but contained by none is [root element].
    Press [tab] on your keyboard to jump one level from the root element's level.

        <root-element>
            <1-level-nested>
                <2-level-nested>
                    <etc></etc>
                </2-level-nested>
            </1-level-nested>
        </root-element>

    When an element (outer tag + content + outer tag) is nested within the root element it is called a 1 level nested element.
    When an element is nested within a 1 level nested element it is called a 2 level nested element. And so on.
    This concept can be defined as nesting level.

    Different relationships between nested elements from the perspective of a [child] element:

            <ancestor>
                <ancestor>
                    <parent>
                        *<child></child>*
                        <sibling></sibling>
                    </parent>
                </ancestor>
            </ancestor>

        The element directly nesting it (the [child]) is its [parent].
        The element in its same level is its [sibling].
        The [child] is also its [sibling's] [sibling].
        Any element nesting its [parent] is its [ancestor] (indirect).
        Its [parent] also counts as an [ancestor] (direct).
        The [child] is also the [descendant] of any of its [ancestors].

Frequent Used Attributes.

    id=""
        Attribute used to identify a unique object in CSS. Can only be used in one element.

    class=""
        Attribute used to identify an object class in CSS. Can be used in many elements at once.

    style=""
        Attribute used to edit the CSS properties of an element while staying within HTML.
        Any property can be added and edited.
        It can be used in any element.
        It is not reccomended to use this attribute unless it is for testing purposes.

    lang=""
        Attribute used to specify the language of an element's content.
        The language is expressed in laguage codes.
        Common laguage codes are: en (english), es (spanish), pt (portuguese), fr (french), it (italian), de (german), ru (russian) and chinese (zh). 
        For more language codes, search "ISO 639-1 language codes".

Block Element:

    Always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). Important block elements: <section>, <div>, <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <aside>, <form>, <h1>-<h6>, <p>, <blockquote>, <ol>, <ul>, <dl>, <table>, <figure>, <video>, <footer>, <address>.
		
Inline Element:

    It does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. Important inline elements: <span>, <a>, <b>, <strong>, <i>, <em>, <code>, <sub>, <sup>, <abbr>, <q>, <label>.
			
Table Element: 

    Always starts on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. Important inline elements: <table>.

From this point on, the different HTML elements and their attributes (displayed as code snippets) will be located where they would normally be located in an HTML document (in the same nesting level), but tags will not nest other elements as they normally would (instead they will immediately close).
Explanations will be located one line after their respective elements.
